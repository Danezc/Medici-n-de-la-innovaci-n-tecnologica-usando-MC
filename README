To validate the variables that have historically most influenced innovation
technology of Colombia, first, descriptive statistics and diagrams of
Pearson correlation, using the Python programming language.
Pseudorandom numbers are generated through the “Random” object and the
seed (171239) of the “Numpy” library, the same library that is used as support for
conducting descriptive statistics. Likewise, the “Scipy” library is used as
basis for some descriptive and inferential analyses.
The graphs and drawings will be made through the "MatPlotLib" and "Seaborn" libraries in
Python. Databases are created in the Excel program and imported into Python
through the "Pandas" library, It is also used to apply all data analysis.
The Sklearn library is used as support for the validation of the variables and obtaining the
model by Principal Component Analysis.
